✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

✨ **[Native federation, @angular-architects/native-federation ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/native-federation?activeTab=readme) is used to create micro-frontend architecture** ✨

✨ **[Kendo UI for Angular](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/getting-started/) is used for UI components** ✨

✨ **[Okta Angular SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-angular) is used to add authentication and authorization** ✨

## Start the application

Run `npx nx serve shell` to start the development server (shell).

Run `npx nx serve remote1` to start the remote1 development server (mfe1).

Run `npx nx serve voya-me` to start the voya-me development server (mfe2).

Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build shell` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
